1. This is a short numbered list item that should not wrap at all since it's under the limit.

2. This is a much longer numbered list item that should definitely wrap properly and maintain the
   correct indentation level aligned with the text after the number.

3. This is another long item that will wrap. We want to make sure that multiple paragraphs work
   correctly and that the indentation remains consistent throughout all wrapped lines in the list.

4. Let's try one with a really long first word likethisreallylongwordthatwillprobablycauseissues
   followed by more text that should wrap properly.

5. Finally testing a case where we have multiple numbers: 123 456 789 and some other text that
   should wrap while maintaining proper indentation alignment with the text. 

50000. Finally testing a case where we have multiple numbers: 123 456 789 and some other text that
       should wrap while maintaining proper indentation alignment with the text. 



The case with no new lines:
