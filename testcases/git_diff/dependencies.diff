         <p>And this is just an ordinary paragraph that is also in the dependencies section. It is poorly formatted which is OK because it is pre-existing.</p>
 
+        <p>BUT THIS IS A NEW paragraph that we're adding, and even though it started out too long, the formatter should pick it up and format it correctly.</p>

+        <ol>
+         <li><p>This would normally be picked up by the formatter, but because we broadly exempt all list items in the Dependencies section, sadly we don't pick it up. Oh well. If it's a problem we can fix it.</p></li>

   <h4>The next section</h4>

+         <li><p>Since we're out of the dependencies section, now we're back to formatting list items correctly. This one is too long and should be fixed by the formatter.</p></li>
