      <p>This is a line that's suboptimally wrapped
      and all of these lines after it are also
      pre-existing. But the point is that in the
      middle of this suboptimally-wrapped paragraph,
      a bunch of new text is inserted (RIGHT HERE) and the rest
      of the paragraph is then optimally wrapped to 100
      columns. This bifurcates the paragraph into two halves,
      the suboptimal half before the insertions, and the
      optimal half AFTER them.</p>
