<!-- This test shows broken formatting behavior: we append "adding more text here that is too long"
to an already-formatted line, and specfmt properly formats that line, but none after it even though
the subsequent lines may need reformatting after we format the single line with the addition-->


                          <p>This is my specification and it is intended for authors of documents
                          and scripts that use the features defined in this specification and so on adding more text here that is too long
                          and more things similar to the other things and workers and threads and
                          documents woohoo that stuff is just so great let's write specs until we
                          can't type anymore that's my ted talk.</p>
