1. This is a short numbered list item that should not wrap at all since it's under the limit.

2. This is a much longer numbered list item that should definitely wrap properly and maintain the correct indentation level aligned with the text after the number.

3. This is another long item that will wrap. We want to make sure that multiple paragraphs work correctly and that the indentation remains consistent throughout all wrapped lines in the list.

4. Let's try one with a really long first word likethisreallylongwordthatwillprobablycauseissues followed by more text that should wrap properly.

5. Finally testing a case where we have multiple numbers: 123 456 789 and some other text that should wrap while maintaining proper indentation alignment with the text. 

50000. Finally testing a case where we have multiple numbers: 123 456 789 and some other text that should wrap while maintaining proper indentation alignment with the text. 


Also markdown lines starting with * should be handled like numbered lists:
* This
* This line is way too long fjaslk fekljaf kwejfk wejlkfj ewklfjweklf jawelkjfawekljf awelkj fwaklejfaeklwjfklewja
  * The other

And lists with spacing like this:
* This

* This line is way too long fjaslk fekljaf kwejfk wejlkfj ewklfjweklf jawelkjfawekljf awelkj fwaklejfaeklwjfklewja

  * The other


The case with no new lines:

Suboptimally-wrapped lists:

1. Suboptimally wrapped
lines like this get smooshed upwards and wrapped correctly, because the top line that is suboptimally wrapped is not treated as must-break.
2. But numbered lines *after*
   are treated as though they must start on a new line, so there
   is no risk
   of this list item getting smooshed up to the first one.

* Suboptimally wrapped
UNORDERED lines like this get smooshed upwards and wrapped correctly, because the top line that is suboptimally wrapped is not treated as must-break.
* But numbered lines *after*
  are treated as though they must start on a new line, so there
  is no risk
  of this list item getting smooshed up to the first one.

1. Numbered list
   * With interleaved unordered list that is
suboptimally wrapped
   * And all of this
     is still formatted correctly
2. This line remains untouched
